  \cventry{April 2016 - June 2016}{Computer Vision Engineer}{NJUST}{Nanjing, China}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Built a website(https://njoj.org/), which is online judge system.
      \item Used django to build the back-end system and Bootstrap to design the webpages.
    \end{itemize}
  }
I also want to use research achievements for solving problems in real world. Now, I now participating in a national collegiate robot contest, the Robomasters Competition, which will be held in June, 2016. This competition requires teams to design unmanned vehicles with automatic target recognition, tracking system, and path planning function, which can automatically fire shells to fight against enemy unmanned vehicles. Currently, we use 3D printing to build the launcher and use STM chips to control travelling of the unmanned vehicles. Since Mainfold, a kind of mini Personal Computer (PC) with Navida CUDA, is the core of unmanned vehicle, I have to do development in computer vision and artificial intelligence under low-power consumption and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) environment. 

  \cventry{March 2016 -- April 2016}{Compete in ASC Student Supercomputer Challenge}{Inspur Group Co., Ltd.}{China}{}{
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Won Prize of Excellence in the challenge.
        \item Designed and optimize algorithms in HPC.
        \item Used HPCG Test to get highest possible efficiency.
        \item Gave an useful optimization for the DNN program on the CPU + MIC Platform.
      \end{itemize}

  \cventry{January 2016 -- April 2016}{Data Science Engineering Intern}{Future Network institute}{Nanjing, China}{}{
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Aanlyzed the data provided by AP and WiFi monitors every day.
        \item Used Spark to deal with the whole log data provided by monitors. 
        \item Developed a model to track each person's network behavior in the whole system.
      \end{itemize}
